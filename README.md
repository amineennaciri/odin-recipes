This is the recipes project from TOP(the odin project) foundations course.

This project is about building a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my HTML knowledge.


Self-reflection and conclusion:

This project was a great opportunity to put into practice my HTML knowledge.
I was able to build a recipe page that act as a directory for multiple individual recipes pages.
I was able to build a simple layout including an image, a description an unordored list for ingrediants and an ordered list for steps.
The website have a simple layout in a minimalistic way, but it includes the important informations needed to realize a cooking recipe.
